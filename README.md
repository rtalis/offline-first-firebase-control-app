# offline-first-firebase-control-app
A simple flutter app that helps me to control the inputs i use and fixes i do in my daily job. 

My main effort and most interesting part of this repo is the cache first firebase part in the storate.dart file. It will get the timestamp of the last update on the server and update only the documents that are not updated in cache. 

You'll need to link the repo to a firebase project.
